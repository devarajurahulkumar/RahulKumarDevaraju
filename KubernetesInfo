Remember, Kubernetes Pods are ephemeral.

They can die and go away at any time.

Thatâ€™s why you never point any type of endpoint to them.

Instead, you use a Service.

Services sit in front of Pods, so regardless of if a Pod dies or not, end users hit the Service, which results in the traffic hitting any of the available Pods.

Services are a reliable network endpoint.
